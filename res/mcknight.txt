My shattered dreams and broken heart
Are mending on the shelf
I saw you holding hands standing close to someone else
Now I sit all alone, wishing all my feeling was gone
I'd give my best to you
Nothing for me to do
But have one last cry
One last cry
Before I leave it all behind
I've gotta put you out of my mind, this time
Stop living a lie
I guess I'm down to one last cry
Cry
I was here, you were there
Guess we never could agree
While the sun shines on you,
I need some love to rain on me
Still, I sit all alone,
Wishing all my feeling was gone
Gotta get over you
Nothing for me to do
But have one last cry
