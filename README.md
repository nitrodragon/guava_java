# Guava Collection
#### A lovely little repo that shows the process of me learning Java 8 and Google Guava

## The Main Gist of Things
This repo is just a quick repo showing my progress of learning this library. It'll be chock-full of example code, tests, and mistakes. 
## SRC
The src directory is dedicated to the library I'm trying to learn. It'll all be code from Zetcode's _Google Guava Tutorial_. 
## Test/Java8Fix
Now, this is where I have a little fun. As Java 8 grew, it began to add a lot of methods that Guava once exclusively supported. Now, Java 8 supports it, and I post what it looks like in Java 8 for comparison.
